# replit-python-bot

A project to create a discord bot using Python that follows [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&list=WL&index=1&t=34s).

The project is hosted in Repl.it, an online collaborative IDE that allows the bot to run without hosting it physically. [Click here](https://replit.com/@joncc99/replit-python-bot#main.py) to view the repository.

### Future Plans
- Host physically
- Move from replit to github
- Add functionality for games or other general stats
